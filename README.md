# Advanced TensorFlow Techniques

Welcome to my repository showcasing advanced techniques in TensorFlow. These notebooks are based on tutorials from the Deep Learning AI Coursera courses. They demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models using custom and distributed training methods.

## What's Included

### 1. Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow
- **ResNet.ipynb**: Implementation of the ResNet architecture using custom models and layers.
- **Training_Fashion_MNIST_Using_Custom_Training_Loop.ipynb**: Custom training loop for the Fashion MNIST dataset, showcasing flexibility in training deep learning models.
- **VGGNetwork.ipynb**: Implementation of the VGG network with custom layers and loss functions.

### 2. Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow
- **Breast_Cancer_Prediction_with_Deep_Learning.ipynb**: A deep learning model to predict breast cancer, focusing on custom and distributed training.
- **Distributed_Training_on_the_Oxford_Flowers_102_dataset.ipynb**: Example of distributed training on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.
- **Horses_or_Humans_Training_with_Graph_Mode_Tensorflow.ipynb**: Training a model to distinguish between horses and humans using TensorFlow's graph mode.
